# value-sharing
Experiments to benchmark different value sharing approaches


TODO :
* Epoch EarlyStopping
* Learn on only one mini-batch and not one epoch
* Add case in fl_train when only 1 node in node_list
* Estimate error on test set
* Create a 'FL baseline': FL without aggregation of models, each node separately
* Should test data be split among nodes or kept central?
* Compute contributivity on test set errors
* [Done] Test different data split scenario
